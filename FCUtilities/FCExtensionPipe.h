// A basic way for members of a shared iOS App Group container to pass messages to each other.
//
// Any given pipe identifier should be one-way within a process, and each pipe should only have one writer, e.g.:
//
//  - the master app can write to a pipe named e.g. "fromApp" but should not read from it, while extensions can read it
//  - an extension could write to a pipe named e.g. "fromWatchKit" that the master app reads from but doesn't write
